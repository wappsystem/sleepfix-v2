                <p>The following document governs your use of the ‘SleepFix’ mobile application and its associated domains and functions which is owned and operated by the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research (ABN 88 002 198 905; “We”, “the Woolcock”). By downloading SleepFix or using any of the domains or functions, you accept and consent to all of the following terms outlined in the following Terms of Use and Privacy Policy document. Please review the following details before using the service.</p>
                <p style='font-weight:bold'>A note of exception to this policy document</p>
                <p>Please note that in cases where SleepFix and its associated domains and functions are being provided to a user for clinical research and/or studies, as determined by the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, the study policies and terms always take precedence over those outlined in this document.</p>
                <h5>Terms of Use</h5>
                <p style='font-weight:bold'>What is SleepFix?</p>
                <p>SleepFix is a self-help sleep therapy delivered by a smartphone application for individuals with insomnia and sleeping difficulties. The app uses an evidence-based behavioral therapy (brief behavioural therapy for insomnia) and was developed by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers and health professionals. It works by providing sleep schedules to individuals to gradually spend more time in bed asleep rather than awake in bed.</p>
                <p>SleepFix self-guides the user through a new sleep schedule which aims to reduce excessive time in bed awake. Users complete a daily sleep diary which takes approximately 5 minutes per day to monitor the new sleep schedule and help retrain the users sleep. It is recommended that SleepFix users will use the program for 6 weeks to ensure any results are maintained, although the program can be completed in 3 weeks.</p>
                <p>SleepFix is best used alone and not in conjunction with other sleep treatments such as medications or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy as they may affect the efficacy of the SleepFix program.</p>
                <p style='font-weight:bold'>How does SleepFix help people with insomnia or poor sleep?</p>
                <p>SleepFix is for adults with poor sleep who simply want to build good sleep health. It is a self-help program with the objective of sleep education. It is not intended to diagnose or treat insomnia, or otherwise replace any medical advice or guidance by a qualified healthcare professional.</p>
                <p>At present, SleepFix has been created for anyone who:
                    <ul>
                        <li>would like to build better sleep health AND</li>
                        <li>is at least 18 years of age AND</li>
                        <li>can read and understand English AND</li>
                        <li>has access to a smartphone</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>By using SleepFix and the associated services, you agree that you fulfil the above target audience criteria.</p>
                <p style='font-weight:bold'>How is SleepFix delivered? </p>
                <p>SleepFix is a mobile application available on both iOS and Android smartphones that can be downloaded from the device’s participating app store with a valid app store account. The application requires an internet connection for access to the app features.</p>
                <p>The following device specifications are required for the current version of SleepFix:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A smartphone (using iOS 11 or later, or Android 10 or later)</li>
                        <li>a stable internet connection or mobile data</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Please note that SleepFix is not optimised for tablet devices</p>
                <p style='font-weight:bold'>Access</p>
                <p>SleepFix is made available to download to users with an internet-connected smartphone device, and an access code that is provided to users as research participants of  the University of Sydney and the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research. The Woolcock Institute of Medical Research reserves the right to change the method of access to the app in the future.</p>
                <p style='font-weight:bold'>Funding</p>
                <p>The SleepFix mobile app is offered by the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, which is an independent not-for-profit research organization in affiliation with the University of Sydney. The mobile application was developed with funding from the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Alertness Safety and Productivity.</p>
                <p style='font-weight:bold'>Health care professionals’ involvement</p>
                <p>While a multidisciplinary team of health professionals designed and developed the SleepFix mobile application, SleepFix is available as a self-guided program only and sleep health professionals will not be involved with the individual delivery of the program.</p>
                <p>SleepFix was created by a research team of academics and clinicians who are experts in sleep. The research team consists of:<br>
                    Associate Professor Christopher Gordon (PhD)<br>
                    Associate Professor Delwyn Bartlett (PhD)<br>
                    Professor Ron Grunstein (MD, PhD)<br>
                    Professor Nick Glozier (MBBS, PhD)<br>
                    Professor Rafa Calvo (PhD)<br>
                    Dorian Peters (MMDes)<br>
                    Dr Melissa Aji (PhD)<br>
                    Marlon Santos [Programmer] </p>
                <p>Sleep and medical health researchers will continue to be involved in the app’s safety and quality assurance processes.</p>
                <p style='font-weight:bold'>Clinical Efficacy</p>
                <p>The delivery of digital brief behavioural therapy via the Sleepfix app has been tested, including in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and multiple user interviews to demonstrate its safety, efficacy and effectiveness in improving the symptoms of sleep disturbance and insomnia in people with insomnia. </p>
                <P>If you would like to read more about the research development of Sleepfix, previously published studies are available. See:</p>

                <p style='font-weight:bold'>Safety</p>
                <p>The SleepFix program, while personalized, should not be considered personal health advice given that it does not take into account your entire sleep health or broader medical circumstances. We encourage all users of SleepFix to seek advice from a qualified health professional if they are worried about their sleep health. Health advice from a medical health professional should take precedence over SleepFix.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions regarding the effect on sleep, please consult your health professional.</p>
                <p>Research indicates that the most common side effect of the brief behavioural therapy for insomnia that the SleepFix app program presents is increased daytime fatigue and sleepiness, especially during the onset of the program. This has been reported to improve after two weeks and further improves following completion of the therapy. Please contact the SleepFix team if you would like more information.</p>

                <p style='font-weight:bold;font-style: italic;'>App usage data</p>
                <p>While using the app, the information about your sleep that you choose to provide will be collected to deliver the SleepFix self-help sleep program efficiently. Users are required to provide inputs to sleep efficiency, quality and sleep-wake parameters including the time you went to and spent in bed vs the time you spent asleep and woke up, along with the number of awakenings per night. Also collected is information about your mood and physical wellbeing each day and how they may have affected your sleep.<br>
                    This non-identifiable data may be pooled in a dataset that may be included in our research and/or further product development. If so, this data is in no way personally identifiable.

                <p>The SleepFix app has been optimized with a third-party smartwatch integration. At present, this integration is limited to Fitbit wearable devices with sleep-tracking capability. The objective sensor data is collected by the SleepFix app to complete the sleep diary and calculate the sleep window. <b>Fitbit has no access to data generated by the SleepFix app.</b></p>
                <p>As you are required to download the Fitbit mobile application to allow synching of sleep tracking data with the SleepFix app, you will be subject to Fitbit’s data sharing and privacy policy (this can be found at: <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/global/au/legal/privacy-policy)">https://www.fitbit.com/global/au/legal/privacy-policy)</a>.</p>
